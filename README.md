## Features

- Automatically trains Uma

- Checks mood
- Handle debuffs
- Rest
- Prioritizes G1 races if available for fan farming
- Stat target feature, if a stat already hits the target, skip training that one
- Auto-purchase skill
- Web Interface for easier configuration

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Setup

#### Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/samsulpanjul/umamusume-auto-train.git
cd umamusume-auto-train
```

#### Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### BEFORE YOU START

Make sure these conditions are met:

- Screen resolution must be 1920x1080
- The game should be in fullscreen
- Your Uma must have already won the trophy for each race (the bot will skips the race)
- Turn off all confirmation pop-ups in game settings
- The game must be in the career lobby screen (the one with the Tazuna hint icon)

### Start

Run:

```
python main.py
```

Start:
press `f1` to start/stop the bot.

### Configuration

Open your browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to easily edit the bot's configuration.

### Training Logic

There are 2 training logics used:

1. Train in the area with the most support cards.
2. Train in an area with a rainbow support bonus.

During the first year, the bot will prioritize the first logic to quickly unlock rainbow training.

Starting from the second year, it switches to the second logic. If there’s no rainbow training and the failure chance is still below the threshold, it falls back to the first one.

### Known Issue

- Some Uma that has special event/target goals (like Restricted Train Goldship or 2 G1 Race Oguri Cap) may not working.
- OCR might misread failure chance (e.g., reads 33% as 3%) and proceeds with training anyway.
- Automatically picks the top option during chain events. Be careful with Acupuncture event, it always picks the top option.
- If you bring a friend support card (like Tazuna/Aoi Kiryuin) and do recreation, the bot can't decide whether to date with the friend support card or the Uma.
- When `prioritize_g1_race` is set to `true`, the bot will always prioritize racing, even if your energy is low or you've already done 3 or more consecutive races.

### TODO

- ~~Prioritize G1 races for farm fans~~
- ~~Auto-purchase skills~~
- Automate Claw Machine event
- ~~Add stat target feature, if a stat already hits the target, skip training that one~~
